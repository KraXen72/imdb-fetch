# imdb-fetch
find imdb id for movies by title or imdb id.   
*i made this solely because imdb.com was too slow and i just needed the ids.*

it's not perfect, only gives like ~10 results because it uses imdb's official Suggest json-p api, rather than OMDBapi.  
- update featuring OMDBapi integration and svelte rewrite coming ***soonâ„¢***
